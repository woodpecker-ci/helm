# Woodpecker Helm Charts

This repository contains the helm charts of the [Woodpecker](https://woodpecker-ci.org) project.

{{ template "chart.deprecationWarning" . }}

{{ template "chart.badgesSection" . }}

**Source Code**: <https://github.com/woodpecker-ci/woodpecker>

## Installation

To install the latest release of the chart:

```sh
helm repo add woodpecker https://woodpecker-ci.org/

helm install woodpecker-agent woodpecker/woodpecker
```

**Note**: The `woodpecker/woodpecker` chart contains both the server and the agent.
If you want to install only the server or agent you can use the [`woodpecker/server`](./charts/server/README.md) or [`woodpecker/agent`](./charts/server/README.md) charts respectively.

### `Next` version

To install Woodpecker from the latest commit of the `main` branch ([Which version of Woodpecker should I use?](https://woodpecker-ci.org/faq#which-version-of-woodpecker-should-i-use)) use the following values:

```yml
# values.yml

agent:
  image:
    tag: "next"

server:
  image:
    tag: "next"
```

### Terraform

If you're using the `helm-release` terraform module, the following definition can be used:

```hcl
resource "helm_release" "woodpecker" {
  name             = "woodpecker"
  chart            = "woodpecker"
  repository       = "https://woodpecker-ci.org/"
  create_namespace = true # optional
  version          = {{ template "chart.version" . }}
  namespace        = "woodpecker"
  count            = 1 # optional
  timeout          = 90 # optional
```

## Versioning

We use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) to be able,
to communicate when admins have to do manual migration steps and when they can just bump versions up.

## Contributing

- The README is generated via [`helm-docs`](https://github.com/norwoodj/helm-docs).
  To generate it, run `make docs` and **do not** run `helm-docs` directly (as the main chart uses a custom template)
- Don't edit `README.md` directly, it will be overwritten by `helm-docs`. Instead, edit the respective `*.gotmpl` files.
